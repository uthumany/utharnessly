## Installer and package matrix

| Method | Scope | Result | Evidence / boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| curl POSIX installer | Linux/macOS x64 | Passed in local/hosted checks | Native archive and checksum flow; macOS local execution unavailable. |
| PowerShell installer | Windows x64 | Passed in hosted workflow | Native Windows shell not available locally. |
| npm / npx / pnpm / pnpx | Supported native release targets | Source package 0.2.7 clean install passed; registry 0.2.7 publication pending | NPM launcher downloads, verifies, caches, and forwards. |
| Bun / bunx | Launcher compatibility | Partial | Documentation-only compatibility class; Bun runtime not installed in sandbox. |
| PyPI / pip / pipx / python -m | Supported native release targets | Source wheel/sdist clean install passed; registry 0.2.7 publication pending | Python unittest, build, local virtualenv install, and version checks passed. |
| uv / uvx | Python launcher path | Partial | Manifest supports it; uv-specific installation not executed in this environment. |
| Cargo | Source/native CLI | Passed for build; complete UI install requires separate UI build | `cargo build --release`; bare cargo install is not advertised as complete TUI packaging. |

| Homebrew | No maintained formula | Unsupported product channel | Use curl/archive or source workflow. |
| apt | No Debian repository | Unsupported product channel | Use curl/archive or source workflow; Termux APT is separate. |
| Nix | No flake/derivation | Source-only | Use Rust/Node/pnpm source workflow. |
| Volta/mise/fnm/nvm/Corepack | Prerequisite managers | Partial | Managers can provide Node/pnpm prerequisites but do not install the Rust product. |
| Rush/Lerna/cnpm | Not used by repository | Unsupported/not required | Repository uses pnpm lockfile directly. |
| Git | Source installation | Passed for clone/build workflow | Requires Rust stable, Node 22, and pnpm. |
| winget | Prerequisite channel | Unsupported product package | Use PowerShell installer or source after installing prerequisites. |

## Feature matrix

| Trusted shell policy | `run --allow --command` | Destructive denylist | Exit status reported | Passed for safe command; destructive command denied. |
| Memory | `memory add/search/list` | No matches | SQLite FTS | Passed. |
| Sessions | `sessions new/list` | Invalid UUID/missing session | SQLite | Passed. |
| Doctor | `doctor` | Missing optional provider/tools | Readable diagnostics | Passed. |
| Skill registry | `skills`, search, categories, install/remove/test/doctor/run | Unsafe/external metadata | Quarantine/health state | Built-in lifecycle passed; external adapters intentionally limited. |

## Release status

The published v0.2.6 release and Termux repository are available, signed, and verified from public endpoints. The current source tree contains the coordinated 0.2.7 version correction and regression coverage; a new release and registry publication are required before calling the source and registries synchronized. No critical defect is currently reproducible in the tested environments. The principal remaining risk is direct device and restricted-platform validation.
